# Tag System - Quick Start Guide

## What Are Tags?

Tags are **color-coded labels** you can create and apply to your todos for better organization and filtering. Think of them like labels in Gmail or tags in note-taking apps.

**Examples**:
- 🟢 **Work** - Professional tasks
- 🔵 **Personal** - Home and family tasks
- 🔴 **Urgent** - High-priority items
- 🟡 **Finance** - Budget and money matters

---

## Getting Started (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Your First Tags

1. Click the **"+ Manage Tags"** button (emerald green, top-right of page)
2. In the modal that opens:
   - Enter a tag name (e.g., "Work")
   - Click the color picker to choose a color (or type a hex code like `#10B981`)
   - Click **"Create Tag"**
3. Repeat for more tags (Personal, Urgent, etc.)
4. Click **"Close"** when done

**💡 Pro Tip**: Choose distinct colors so you can spot tags at a glance!

### Step 2: Apply Tags to a Todo

**When Creating a New Todo**:
1. Fill out the todo form as usual (title, due date, priority)
2. Below the form, you'll see your tags as pill buttons
3. Click a tag to select it (it will fill with color and show a checkmark ✓)
4. Click multiple tags to apply several at once
5. Click **"Add"** to create the todo

**When Editing an Existing Todo**:
1. Click **"Edit"** on any todo
2. Scroll down to see the tags section
3. Click tags to toggle them on/off
4. Click **"Save"** to apply changes

### Step 3: Filter by Tags

1. Look for the **"All Tags"** dropdown (next to "All Priorities")
2. Select a tag name to filter
3. Only todos with that tag will appear
4. Select "All Tags" again to see everything

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple Tags Per Todo

**Why Use Multiple Tags?**

Example todo: **"Prepare Q4 Financial Report"**
- Tag it with: `Work` + `Urgent` + `Finance`
- Filter by `Work` to see all work tasks
- Filter by `Urgent` to see critical items
- Filter by `Finance` to see money-related tasks

### Combining Filters

**Powerful Combinations**:

1. **Search + Tag**:
   - Search: "meeting"
   - Tag: "Work"
   - → Shows only work-related meetings

2. **Priority + Tag**:
   - Priority: High
   - Tag: "Personal"
   - → Shows high-priority personal tasks

3. **Search + Priority + Tag**:
   - Search: "report"
   - Priority: High
   - Tag: "Finance"
   - → Shows high-priority finance reports

### Recurring Todos & Tags

**Tags Persist on Recurring Todos!**

Example:
1. Create recurring todo "Weekly Team Meeting"
2. Tag it with "Work" + "Meetings"
3. When you complete it, the next instance **keeps the same tags**

## Troubleshooting

### "Tag name already exists"

**Problem**: You tried to create a tag with the same name as an existing one.

**Solution**: 
- Choose a different name (e.g., "Work Projects" instead of "Work")
- Or edit the existing tag instead

### Tags not showing on todo

**Problem**: You selected tags but they don't appear after creating todo.

**Solution**:
- Make sure you clicked "Add" after selecting tags
- Check if tags appear in the modal (may be a display issue)
- Try refreshing the page

### Tag filter not working

**Problem**: Selecting a tag doesn't filter the list.

**Solution**:
- Clear other filters first (search, priority)
- Make sure some todos actually have that tag
- Try selecting "All Tags" then the tag again

### Can't delete tag

**Problem**: Delete button doesn't work or tag reappears.

**Solution**:
- Make sure you clicked "Delete" not "Edit"
- Confirm the deletion dialog if it appears
- Refresh the page if tag still shows

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small

**Don't Create Too Many Tags Initially**:
- ❌ Bad: Create 20+ tags on day one
- ✅ Good: Start with 3-5 essential tags
- Add more as needed based on actual usage

### 2. Use Consistent Colors

**Color Coding System**:
- 🟢 Green = Work/Professional
- 🔵 Blue = Personal/Life
- 🔴 Red = Urgent/Critical
- 🟡 Yellow = Finance/Admin
- 🟣 Purple = Health/Wellness

### 3. Combine with Priority

**Tags = Category, Priority = Urgency**:
- Tag: What type of task
- Priority: How soon it needs doing

Example:
```
🟢 Work + 🔴 High Priority = Urgent work task
🔵 Personal + 🟢 Low Priority = Someday personal task
```

### 4. Review and Clean Up

**Monthly Tag Review**:
- Delete unused tags
- Merge similar tags (e.g., "Work" + "Office" → "Work")
- Update colors if needed for better visibility

### 5. Don't Over-Tag

**Keep It Simple**:
- ❌ Bad: 5+ tags per todo
- ✅ Good: 1-3 tags per todo
- Too many tags = defeats the purpose

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Color Psychology

**Choose Colors That Match Meaning**:
- 🔴 Red = Urgent, Important, Stop
- 🟢 Green = Go, Complete, Growth
- 🔵 Blue = Calm, Trust, Stability
- 🟡 Yellow = Caution, Attention, Energy

### Tip 2: Tag Naming Conventions

**Clear, Concise Names**:
- ✅ "Work" not "Work Related Tasks"
- ✅ "Urgent" not "URGENT!!!"
- ✅ "Finance" not "Financial Stuff"

**Use Prefixes for Grouping**:
- `Project: Alpha`, `Project: Beta` (collapses alphabetically)
- `@home`, `@office` (GTD contexts)
- `#client1`, `#client2` (hashtag style)

### Tip 3: Export Your Setup

**Share Tag System with Others**:
1. Document your tag names and colors
2. Share with teammates using the same app
3. Everyone uses consistent tagging

### Tip 4: Seasonal Tags

**Create Temporary Tags**:
- "Q4 2025" for quarter-specific work
- "Holiday Prep" for seasonal tasks
- "Tax Season" for annual events
- Delete when period ends

### Tip 5: Combine with Search

**Power User Technique**:
1. Filter by tag (e.g., "Work")
2. Then search within results (e.g., "meeting")
3. Narrow down to exact tasks quickly
